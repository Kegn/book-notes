# Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance

by : Robert M. Pirsig

## Chapter Five

They're headed through the high plains. They stop for some coffee and gas. TYhe narrator buys Chris some goggles and they look at the map for the route across the Missouri. They have to take a road that is not very fun. A lot of hills and 18-wheelers.

The narrator hears an echo in his engine and reflects on another time of motorcycle maintenance with John. To John, using an old beer can as a shim was offensive.

They decide to camp. It's late and everyone is extremely tired and frustrated. Chris begins to show signs of discomfort, making a scene. Later, when talking with John and Slyvia, they talk about Chris' stomach pains and how the doctors have called it a mental illness. We learn that the narrator has a wife, but brought Chris on the trip instead.

Chris finally reappears at the tent, and he tries to be friendly. The narrator is tired and responds coldly. It sounds like Chris had been crying. 

The narrator dreams of riding a horse with Chris and sees Phadreus. He believes the ghost is calling Chris.
