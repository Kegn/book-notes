## Chapter Three

The storm comes in and they speed up. The rain begins and they slow down. They meet up with John and Sylvia under a tree when they catch up. They get to a motel and talk about ghosts. Chris tells some ghost stories and that Tom White Bear believes in them. There is a debate over whether the laws of gravity existed before Newton. The argument here is that the law is a construct of the mind and is therefore a ghost. 

When they go to bed that night, Chris pushes to hear a ghost story. The narrator mentions Phaedrus to Chris, a man who went hunting for a ghost and found him and then turned into a ghost himself. He then thinks about how Phaedrus is out there, following them. The ideas in his head arent his, but those of Phaedrus. He goes to sleep.
