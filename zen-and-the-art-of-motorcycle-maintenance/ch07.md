## Chapter Seven

It's 102 degrees out and they can barely take it. They stop at a restaurant and before they go in they speak with an old man reminiscing about when he owned a cycle.

The author uses a methaphor, calling our selected perceptions a pile of sand. The romantic view is the sand before it is divided, whereas the analytic viewpoint is categorizing the sand based on specific properties. He mentions the Buddah, and how it is everywhere. It is no single grain of sand; it is all of it. He also mentions that there is Buddah in analytic thought.

Looking at a madman, one only sees the fact that he knows he is a madman and can't really see him at all. Phaedrus was after rationality.

They stop again and it is still extremely hot outside. The narrator suggest slowing down because it is bad for the tires. Back out on the road, John keeps pushing it fast and the narrator slows down.

We learn more of Paedrus and his origins. It seems like the narrator was phaedrus in another life, before he woke up in a hospital having been treated with shock therapy with only memory and a slip of paper from the cxourt to prove it.

They arrive at a huge valley and look out over the meadows.
