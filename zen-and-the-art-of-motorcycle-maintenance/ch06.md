# Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance

## Chapter Six

They awake and it is hot. The narrator decides to follow the path of Phaedrus and is tranquil with the decision.

The narrator begins to talk about the *underlying form* of communication.

Two types of people
 - romantics : feels and arts
 - classics : laws and logic

The narrator disects the internal workings of a motorcycle and how it is built and then analyzes the analysis he conducts and explains how it is broken into logical parts and that everyone splits things differently. This is what Phaedrus was good at. He was a master with this knife.
