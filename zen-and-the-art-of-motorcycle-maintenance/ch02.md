# Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance

## Chapter Two 

They're drving through the plains. The narrator talks about seeing something in the plains, an escape from Sylvia's boring city life.

There is a storm coming their way. 

He tells a story of when him and Chris were travelling though Canada. In the story, they encounter a warm front that they were not prepared for. The storm gets pretty bad. They push through until they reach a gas station and pull over. At the time, he knew nothing of motorcycle maintenance. He got angry at Chris because he did not realize how serious it was; he was asking questions like "check for gas, find a mechanic". But when he did see how serious it was, he realized the trip was over and began to cry. He was 8 then. They hitchiked back and got a ride back to their town and did the trip by car. It was less fun. Later, when pulling the cycle apart to determine the cause, it was out of gas.

He tells another story of the times his bike siezed from getting too hot and taking it to a bunch of children (mechanics) to get it fixed. They did not do a good job, leaving him with a much worse bike than before. Multiple times. He talks about how the employees are uninvolved and disconencted from their work, just there for the paycheck.

For a living, the narrator writes and edits technical, digital computer manuals.

Get at things carefully and throroughly.

They enter the Red River Valley.
