# Atomic Habits 

by : James Clear

## How to Make a Habit Irresistable
 - Behavioral rules, aka *supernormal stimuli* are programmed into us
 - To increase the chance of a behavior sticking, you must increase the reward
 - The anticipation of a reward releases dopamine
 - Use temptation to accomplish what you want
```
1. after <current habit> I will <habit i need>
2. after <habit i need> I will <habit i want>
```
