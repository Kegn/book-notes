## How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (And Vice Versa)

Behavior changes are like onions. outcomes -> process -> identity

You must first change your outcomes by changing your results. Then change your process to reflect. This is where habits form. Then lastly, changing your beliefs.

There are two types of habits:
 - Identity-Based
 - Outcome-Based

If you're proud of an aspect of your identity, you'll work hard to keep it intact.

## Two Step Process To Changing Your Identity

 1. Decide who you want to be
 2. Prove it with small wins


You become your habits
