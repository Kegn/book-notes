# Mastery Chapter 1

author: George Leonard


## What is Mastery?
 - you have to think about every part of how you're doing something right or wrong (page 7)
 - then a light goes on, you don't have to think about every little thing (page 8)
 - days and weeks go by; you don't get better. You're on a plateau (page 8)
 - with each stage you have to think again. Things will fall apart (page 10)
 - the mastery curve: you have to spend most of your time on a plateau (page 15)
 - "a stage ends when the habitual system has been programmed to the new task, and the cognitive and effort systems have withrawn." (page 16)
 - practice for the sake of practice itself (page 17)
